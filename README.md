# 2025
2024 was a wild year for everyone myself included. I could ramble for hours about all the stuff that happened but ill sum it up real fast so I can get on to the new stuffs. It was a “doozy,” I reached heights I had never been to but also sunk to places that felt all too familiar.

Going into 2025 I want to commit myself to bettering myself, both in life and in ability. My mom was telling me how her and her friends were picking words to try and make a theme for the improvement. Weirdly enough I watched a video shortly after and they said a similar thing, I think the general “theme” or “goal” I am aiming towards is one mirrored by many: “discipline.”

I have found the most fulfilled times in my life were times I was the most disciplined. When I first decided to try and get a internship I worked hours on my portfolio and resume before applying to a position and got said position! My issue is once I have gotten something I often falter in my discipline and become contempt.

All that yapping out of the way my goals for the year are as follows:
- [ ] Practice Programming for at least 1 hour every day
- [ ] Publish something at least once per month
- [ ] Perform and commit everyday

Above I have outlined my “TRIPPPLE P” plan all very general and easy goals but making sure I work on them everyday is something else. I have smaller goals below for bonus points and to keep myself from believing I have done “all I can”
- [ ] Learn more about creating AI models and training
- [ ] Learn more about Mesh Generation
- [ ] Learn more about Dynamic Programming
- [ ] Become more proficient with VIM
- [ ] Become better at performant programming in C
- [ ] Learn Rust

I am sure I will add more as the year goes on but I will be back here every so often to update the list.

in order to keep myself accountable I will try to commit my learnings to github everyday. maybe its a code snippet, Journey entry, or blog post. Whatever it is I will try to commit to github so I can at the end of the year at least my green squares saying “I did it.”

May it never falter.
